# Optimization Project - Transportation & Assignment Problems

A Python-based implementation of optimization algorithms for solving Transportation and Assignment problems. This project includes solutions for balanced and unbalanced transportation problems, along with visual representations of the solutions.

## Key Features
- Solves balanced and unbalanced transportation problems
- Implements the North-West Corner, Least Cost, and Vogel's Approximation methods
- Generates visual representations of solutions
- Includes test cases and sample problems
- Quick reference guide for problem-solving approaches

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
